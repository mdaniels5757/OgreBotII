This map is based on a map found in Peter Hunter Blair's "Roman Britain and Early England: 55 B.C.-871 A.D.", W.W. Norton, 1963, p. 209.  I have removed Bernicia and Deira from Blair's version since they had lost their independence by the end of the eighth century.  I've used names of states rather than peoples, added Dal Riata, and moved Strathclyde slightly.
