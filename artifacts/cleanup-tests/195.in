{{Information
| description = Amino acids in food and blood ; Schmidt et al. 2016 have analyzed both the amino acid composition of human food and measured the resulting mix of amino acids in blood serum. Intake values in grams per day and plasma values in Î¼mol/L (micromoles per liter) have been converted to % of total in each category. The paper differentiates between meat-eaters, vegetarians, and vegans. The chart only shows meat-eaters versus vegans because the differences there are biggest (despite being small overall). The data does not distinguish between Asp/Asn and Glu/Gln in food. Since according to [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf00096a011 Sosulski 1990] these are usually similar, the chart uses the simplification that they are present in equal quantities. Also, the analysis did unfortunately not measure Cys serum levels, so these were left blank.
