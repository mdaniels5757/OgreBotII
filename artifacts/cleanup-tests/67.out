According to USHMM, this is taken during the liquidation of the [[:en:Mizocz Ghetto|Mizocz Ghetto]] on October 14, 1942. [http://www1.ushmm.org/uia-cgi/uia_doc/query/8?uf=uia_IutJPJ The USHMM photo page] gives the provenance of this image as follows.}}
{{quote|Information regarding this action, including the photos, were acquired from a man named Hille, who was the Bezirks-Oberwachtmeister of the Gendarmerie at the time. Hille apparently gave the five photos (there were originally seven) to the company lawyer of a textile firm in Kunert, Czechoslovakia, where he worked as a doorman after the war. The Czech government confiscated the photos from the lawyer in 1946 and they subsequently became public. That the photos indeed show the shooting of Jews in connection with the liquidation of the ghetto was also confirmed by a statement of Gendarmerie-Gebietsfuehrer Josef Paur in 1961.}}
