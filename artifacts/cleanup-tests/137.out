According to the Cal Poly Pomona University Library Special Collections, once while riding Antez in 1926, Kellogg slipped-off and fell under it while his foot remained caught-up in the stirrup. The horse stood still until help came; thus, preventing Kellogg from sustaining further injuries. Since then, Kellogg maintained that "Antez had saved his life".}}
