== Daily gallery updater has failed on [[$gallery]] == 
Hello. This message is to inform you that a daily gallery in your userspace, [[$gallery]], has failed. Due to software limitations, the bot has a hard upper-limit of $max files per page. After the new edit, the page would have reached $count files.

This usually happens because a gallery is too broad or because the galleries need to encompass a shorter timeframe. Please review your settings and request an appropriate change to your gallery. The logs are available [$log_link here].

Please make your request for removal '''within 4 days''', or your the bot owner will remove the gallery altogether.

Thank you. [[User:Magog the Ogre|]], via ~~~~"

== Daily gallery updater has failed on [[$gallery]] ==
Hello. This message is to inform you that a daily gallery in your userspace, [[$gallery]], has failed. Due to software limitations, the bot has a hard upper-limit of about $max files per day (including overflow galleries), while your gallery had $count files.

This usually happens because a gallery is too broad, encompassing too many subcategories. Please review the logs [$log_link here] and request that a subcategory be excluded, or narrow your category choice(s).

Please make your request for removal '''within 4 days''', or your gallery will be subject to removal.

Thank you. [[User:Magog the Ogre|]] (via ~~~~)"
